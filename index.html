<h1>YX's Note</h1><br>
<h2>What I liked</h2><br>
<font color="white"><b><p>I really like the course because it is so easy</p>
to understand.<br>
<br>
key points I got:
<br>
<br>
1. how the web works - it is the browser find<br> a html file from a server by using<br>
a http protocol.<br>
<br>
2. Html is quite straight forward, it does <br>scare me off at least for now. I don't need to<br>
remeber everything ilke tags or attributes.<br>
I can google it.
<br>
<br>
3. Computer is stupid sounds to me more like<br> you better don't make mistakes. But it is good<br>
Learning systematic problem solving skill is also a <br>great gain.</front>
